#### ~~It is frustrating me that I am not able to figure out how to write in a math environment yet.~~

This would be an example of a blog post, or some place in which I can host my writing. Of course hosting the writing itself is nice, but it would be great to also make the pages more pretty and interactive. I don't want to have those intense cutesie pages, just a well-organized, simple, website with nice color schemes and images, nice (serifed) fonts, etc.

$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}} \mathrm{const.} \, \mathrm{dx} = \infty.\\
\begin{pmatrix} a_i & a_j \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} a_i \\ a_j \end{pmatrix} = a_i^2 + a_j^2
$$
