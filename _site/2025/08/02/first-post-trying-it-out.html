<h1> First Post Trying It Out</h1>

<h4 id="it-is-frustrating-me-that-i-am-not-able-to-figure-out-how-to-write-in-a-math-environment-yet"><del>It is frustrating me that I am not able to figure out how to write in a math environment yet.</del></h4>

<p>This would be an example of a blog post, or some place in which I can host my writing. Of course hosting the writing itself is nice, but it would be great to also make the pages more pretty and interactive. I donâ€™t want to have those intense cutesie pages, just a well-organized, simple, website with nice color schemes and images, nice (serifed) fonts, etc.</p>

\[\int_{\mathbb{R}} \mathrm{const.} \, \mathrm{dx} = \infty.\\
\begin{pmatrix} a_i &amp; a_j \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} a_i \\ a_j \end{pmatrix} = a_i^2 + a_j^2\]
